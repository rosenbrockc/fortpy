#What I learned. gprof is a tool that does exactly what we want and would
#work with both ifort and gfortran (both using the -pg option for compiling
#and for linking. This is supposed to produce a gmon.out file in the directory
#where the executable ran. gprof analyzes the output file and prints nice
#tables with function calls and can even limit the output to just the function
#we are interested in.

#The problem is that Apple's proprietary junk makes it not work. It works on
#linux, but not Mac OSX. The first problem seems to be that the executables
#don't even produce a 'gmon.out' file to analyze. The second is that we don't
#have gprof. The internet says that Apple wants you to use their instruments
#application; but that requires you to attach to a long-running process, which
#then gets analyzed. We just want what gprof does.
